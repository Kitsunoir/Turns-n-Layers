# Turns-n-Layers
Physical design of coils

Turns-n-Layers does the _physical_ design of coils and transformers. This app does not do the electronic design.
You will need a design that specifies the number of turns required. Turns-n-Layers provides information concerning
the finished dimensions of coils. Useful to see if you have enough window space in the core.
