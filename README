Turns-n-Layers is an electronic design aid that calculates the physical
dimensions of a finished coil. These may be would on either round or
rectangular cores.

Units of measurement are the American customary units: inches,
feet, mils, and the B & S American Wire Gage system, as presented in
_The Design and Construction of Induction Coils_ by A. Frederick Collins
(Lindsay Publications Inc.; 1907 / 1990). Measurements may also be entered
as metric units.

details on using Turns-n-Layers, see the on-line help and the man page.
