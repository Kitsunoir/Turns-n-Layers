Turns-n-Layers Help

    The Turns-n-Layers application is an electronic design aid. It does
    the physical design of a
    multi-layer coil, not the electronic design. Given the required
    number of turns, the core dimensions, and the thickness of any layer
    insulation, Turns-n-Layers will calculate the finished dimensions.
    Wire gages from 0 to 40 are supported.

    This is good to know, to see if your proposed design will fit inside
    the "window" of E-I cores, or C-cores. It also estimates the likely
    length and weight of wire needed to complete the coil, and the total resistance of the finished coil.

Main Menu: Project

     NewProj: Start a new project by resetting the app to its initial conditions.
     prompts if a current project is unsaved.

     Total Turns: Determines how many turns can be wound, given a length of wire.

     Wire Length: Determines the length of wire needed to complete a coil.

     Save as...: Save the current project.

     Print...: Print hard copy of the project.

Main Menu: Cores

     Rect: Selects a rectangular core

     Rnd: Selects a round core

User Input:

     The units of measurement is selected via radio buttons.
     Defaults to American customary units.

     Note: Text fields that are not needed are grayed out.

Command Buttons:

    OK: Used to finalize a project and display the results.

    Cancel: Remove the current project before completion and
    reset the app.

Note:

    The results given are accurate for machine wound coils. The
    finished dimensions of hand wound coils will likely vary with
    the winder's experience. When hand winding, expect that the
    final dimensions of the coil(s) is likely to have been
    underestimated.
